# Geometric-Ascension

ABANDONED PROJECT

  Geometric Ascension is a singleplayer Android game about growing as a bubble by fighting others.
  
  The main objective is to ascend the floors as far by defeating each floor's boss, and fighting is done through firing projectiles.
  
  As the player ascends, enemies and bosses get increasingly more difficult and the sheer number of bullets onscreen becomes harder to keep track of.

  Maps consist of an infinite grid of circular play areas that the player can traverse by exiting an area's borders. Each new area contains procedurally generated enemies (other bubbles).
  
  The player can either fight these enemies or run away, at least until the floor's boss is encountered. Once the player finds the boss, escape becomes impossible and the player is forced to try and defeat the boss. If successful, the player is able to enter the next floor. (I never got around to designing more than one or two bosses)

  By killing enemies, the player earns pp (pixel points), the game's currency used for player upgrades, an essential for survival. The player can add new bubbles to their group and/or level up existing ones. Every few levels, the player is able to choose a bubble's specialty.
  
  The most basic specialties are damage, health, and utility.
  
  The damage specialty lowers a bubble's health but significantly increases its attack. It leads into other branches of damage specialization (machine gun, shotgun, and sniper), each having its own use case and even deeper specialization choices.

  The health specialty lowers a bubble's attack but significantly increases its health. Like the other specialties, it can lead into other branches of specialization. Its intended use is to have bubbles that can block other, more vulnerable player bubbles (eg to protect damage specialization bubbles) from enemies.

  The utility specialty, unlike the other two, does not have branches that go deep. It can increase the player's maximum speed or decrease the damage taken by nearby bubbles.
